      <li>
        Turn on a multi-functional pressure cooker (such as Instant PotÂ®) and

      <li>Add olive oil and heat until shimmering.</li>
      <li>Add ham hocks and sear on all sides, about 3 minutes per side.</li>
      <li>
        Add onion and garlic; cook and stir until onion is translucent, about 3
        minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add collard greens, red pepper flakes, salt, black pepper, cayenne
        pepper, and paprika.
      </li>
      <li>
        Close and lock the lid. Select high pressure according to manufacturer's
        instructions; set timer for 15 minutes. Allow 10 to 15 minutes for
        pressure to build.
      </li>
      <li>
        Release pressure using the natural-release method according to
        manufacturer's instructions, for 10 minutes. Release remaining pressure

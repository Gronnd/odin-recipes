    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      After trying air fryer meatballs, I will never bake them in the oven
      again. The insides stay nice and tender while the outsides get a slight
      crisp on them. The best part is that you can make them ahead of time and
      freeze for later use. I have included those directions in the notes. Dip
      meatballs in marinara, if desired.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
      <li>1/2 cup Italian seasoned bread crumbs</li>
      <li>1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
      <li>1/2 cup chopped parsley</li>
      <li>1 egg</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat the air fryer to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C) according to
        manufacturer's instructions.
      </li>
      <li>
        Combine ground beef, bread crumbs, Parmesan cheese, parsley, egg, salt,
        and pepper in a large bowl. Mix well and form into 1 1/2-inch meatballs.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place meatballs in a single layer in the basket of the air fryer. Cook
        in batches if necessary.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cook for 8 minutes. Flip and cook for 2 minutes more. An instant-read
        thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 160 degrees F
        (70 degrees C).
      </li>
    </ol>
